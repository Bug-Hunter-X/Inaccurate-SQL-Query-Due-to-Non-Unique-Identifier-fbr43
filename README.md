# Inaccurate SQL Query Due to Non-Unique Identifier
This repository contains an example of an SQL query that might produce inaccurate results due to the use of a non-unique identifier (employee name) in the WHERE clause.  The query attempts to select employees from the 'Sales' department with a salary greater than 100000. If multiple employees share the same name, the query will return all of them, leading to an incorrect count or data selection.  The solution demonstrates how to correctly use a unique identifier such as employee_id to prevent this issue and produce accurate results.
